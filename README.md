ScheduleSync

 Smart Study Planning Seamlessly Integrated
Plan Seamlessly, Study Smart

## Inspiration: scheduleSync is inspired by the student lifestyle that juggles around academics, extracurricular, and wellbeing. For students to have a successful college career, they must set goals and plan their schedules around these various events, reducing the little time they already have. 

## What it does: scheduleSync is an AI-integrated chatbot designed to help students optimize their study schedules. By leveraging data from existing Google, Outlook, or Apple calendars, the software creates a custom schedule that can be tailored to the userâ€™s unique needs and preferences. This file can be easily uploaded into an online calendar, ensuring seamless integration with the user's existing schedule. They will then be prompted by the chatbot to answer questions regarding their courses, credit hours, grades, and preferences. The gathered data will be transformed into a downloadable .ics file that the user can easily integrate into their calendar. That file was created by determining available free time, uploading study times accordingly. 

## How we built it
To maintain productivity, our team adopted an agile development process, specifically a loose Scrum-style approach. We held regular meetings to check progress and discuss challenges. These meetings enabled us to reevaluate and evolve our goals, defining new objectives for each development cycle. 

## Challenges we ran into
- **Limited Knowledge:** Team members had no prior experience with AI integration, and limited programming skills made debugging quite challenging. To address these issues, we employed AI and online resources while adopting a systems-of-systems approach to minimize the amount of raw code we had to produce.  
- **Lack of Skills Overlap:** This led to reduced overall team productivity. We overcame this by allowing individual strengths to shine and fostering a culture of collaborative learning through AI and online resources.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
With a team formed by members who have little experience building AI agents, we are proud of the back end development in training an AI that considers preferential factors provided by the user to further optimize the study schedule. This includes the difficulty level of courses, preferred study times, and the grades inputted by the user. By taking all these factors into account, the chatbot offers a highly relevant and actionable schedule.

## What we learned
The curve learn in learning how to train an AI Model for a Hackathon project is hard. 

## What's next for ScheduleSync
Utilizing the calendar application also grants users access to additional features such as cross-device syncing, visual time management, automated reminders, and shareability. The high degree of personalization this system provides is intended to enhance productivity and study motivation. By incorporating user input on grades into our scheduling process, we aim to provide an even more dynamic and responsive scheduling solution for students, ensuring they can better allocate their study time based on their academic performance.
